Input

Prompt the user to enter the first date's month (allowing full names or abbreviations) and year.
Prompt the user to enter the second date's month (allowing full names or abbreviations) and year.

Process

Validate Month Input: For each date, validate the month input by converting the full name or abbreviation to a corresponding month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.). 
If the input is invalid, prompt the user again until a valid month is entered.
Validate Year Input: For each date, validate the year input to ensure it's a positive integer. If the input is invalid (non-integer or non-positive), prompt the user again until a valid year is entered.
Determine Month Numbers: Convert the validated month names or abbreviations to their respective month numbers using a predefined array of month names.
Calculate Date Difference:
	Calculate the absolute difference in years between the two dates.
	Calculate the difference in months between the two dates.
	If the month difference is negative, adjust it by adding 12 to the month difference and subtracting 1 from the year difference to properly account for the full year cycle.

Output

Display the Date Difference: Output the calculated difference between the two dates in terms of years and months. Ensure the difference is displayed as non-negative values for both years and months.
