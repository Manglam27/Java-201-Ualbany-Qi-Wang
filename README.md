# Java Lab and Project Repository

These Java files encompass all lab and project work from the Spring 2024 semester under Professor Qi Wang. Engaging in these assignments was a delightful experience, with each lab and project meticulously crafted and logically structured.

## Repository Structure

- **`labs`**: Contains individual lab assignments.
- **`projects`**: Contains individual project assignments.

### Lab Assignments

**Lab 1**: Basic Java Program - "Hello World."
   - A simple program that prints "Hello World" to the console.

**Lab 2**: Two Algorithms - Student Percentages & Money Conversion.
   - Problem 1: Calculates the percentage of male and female students based on user input.
   - Problem 2: Converts a user-entered monetary amount into the fewest number of bills and coins.

**Lab 3**: Student Percentage Calculation.
   - Calculates the percentage of male and female students using object-oriented programming concepts.

**Lab 4**: Enhanced Student Enrollment Analysis.
   - Calculates and displays the percentage of male and female students based on year, semester, and course.

**Lab 5**: Month Conversion to Title Case and Ordinal Number.
   - Converts a user-entered month to title case and includes its ordinal number.

**Lab 7**: File I/O Handling.
   - Captures scores and writes them to a specified file using file handling techniques.

**Lab 8**: Dynamic Score Capturing with File Output.
   - Uses an `ArrayList` to dynamically store scores entered by the user and writes them to a specified file.

**Lab 10**: Date Difference Calculator.
   - Calculates the difference between two dates in years and months.

**Lab 11**: Shapes Package with UML Diagram.
   - Defines classes related to geometric shapes, their properties, and calculations. Includes a UML diagram.

**Lab 12**: Advanced Shapes Management System.
   - Implements an abstract class for shapes with specific subclasses. Defines common properties and functionality for shape objects.

### Project Assignments

1. **Project 1: Money Converter**
   - Converts large sums of money into smaller denominations like $10, $5, $1 bills and coins.

2. **Project 2: Carpet Bill Generator**
   - Generates a bill based on room dimensions and carpet costs.

3. **Project 3: Date Difference Calculator**
   - Calculates the difference between two dates in years and months.

4. **Project 4: Grade Report Generator**
   - Generates and displays a grade report based on test scores.

5. **Project 5: Shape Management System**
   - Manages geometric shapes, providing classes for circles, rectangles, and triangles.
